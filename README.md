# US_States_Game
Simple Game to identify all the US States using Panda and Turtle.

NOTE:
Make sure you change the extension of image from jpeg to gif as turtle graphics supports gif as background.
Additionally, Also change the extension of pages file to csv file.

The code will work perfectly if the above changes are made.
